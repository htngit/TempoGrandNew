- Added proper name parsing to set first_name and last_name fields
- Set appropriate tenant ownership during registration
- Added detailed logging to track the registration process
- Improved error handling during account creation

### 4. Synchronized Tenant Settings with Onboarding Data

## Project Inspiration

The Xalesin CRM project is inspired by Krayin CRM, but has been built from the ground up with a modern tech stack including React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The project is still under development but now has functional core features.

## Conclusion

The project workspace is now better organized with comprehensive documentation and several critical fixes to core functionality. The user management system properly enforces tenant ownership, the settings system correctly displays and saves tenant data, and the registration process correctly sets up new tenant owners.

These improvements have significantly enhanced the application's usability and stability, particularly in the areas of user management, tenant settings, and theme customization.
