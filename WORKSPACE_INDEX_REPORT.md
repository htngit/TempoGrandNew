## Code Fixes

### Fixed Router Navigation Issue

The project had a critical navigation issue where the sidebar navigation links were not working properly. The issue was identified and fixed:

1. **Problem**: The `Sidebar` component was rendering navigation buttons that called an `onNavigate` function that only logged messages instead of actually navigating.

2. **Solution**:
   - Updated `src/components/home.tsx` to import and use React Router's `useNavigate` hook
   - Implemented a proper `handleNavigate` function that calls the React Router navigation method
   - Passed this function to the Sidebar component through the `onNavigate` prop

3. **Impact**: This fix enables users to navigate between different sections of the application by clicking on the sidebar navigation items, which is a core functionality of the application.

## Project Inspiration

The Xalesin CRM project is inspired by Krayin CRM, but has been built from the ground up with a modern tech stack including React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The project is still under development and not fully implemented yet.

## Conclusion

The project workspace now has a comprehensive set of documentation files that provide detailed information about the Xalesin CRM project. This documentation will help new developers understand the project structure, features, and development workflow, as well as provide guidance for contributors.

The documentation is organized in a logical manner, with cross-references between files to help navigate the information. The updated PROJECT_INDEX.md file serves as a central hub for accessing all other documentation.

The router navigation fix addresses a critical usability issue, making the application functional for basic navigation needs.
